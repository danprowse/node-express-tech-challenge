# AWS


A personal side project where i've created a landing page using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Within the page the user has grid tiles that allow a welcome message and a reminder or a todo message to be set. Two grid tiles display rotating news content and one tile outputs the users current weather information.

To access the news data, locally i have created a proxy backend Express server that uses the Novara, Guardian and Weatherapi endpoints to request the information.
